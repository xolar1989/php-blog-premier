                            signed a new six-year contract, securing the 30-year old
                            goalkeeper at least until 2025. In the Premier League i.e.
                            Ederson of Manchester City and Chelsea`s Kepa are bounded as
                            long as the Slovakia international at the Magpies.

                            an impressive start to the Premier League campaign and was in
                            strong contention to make a senior debut in this round of
                            matches.

                            – which, in his view, could also portrait a successful draft for
